### Keyboard
Set Keyboard from System Preference > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts

## Another Method
If you use Automator, opt + number is not working on App Shortcuts
I don't know why It is not working, but Alternatively You can use HotKey to Launch Application
It's more easy way when just to launch app
