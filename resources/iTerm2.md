using font-patcher is not working in iterm2
You should setup in iterm2 preference

## Step
1. download your favor from [patched-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts) and save to any directory then double click `<any-font>.ttf`, then it will automatically install font to your system
2.  Open iTerm2.
3.  Go to the iTerm2 preferences. You can access the preferences by going to `iTerm2` > `Preferences`, or by using the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜,`.
4.  In the iTerm2 preferences, go to the `Profiles` tab.

11.  Select the Nerd Font in the font selector and click the `OK` button.

(I choose [Jetbrain Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono/Ligatures/Regular/complete/JetBrains%20Mono%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono%20Regular.ttf) Nerd Font Regular, it is recommended from someone in [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/kz8d27/what_is_your_favorite_nerd_font_if_any/))

## Notes
Check Font list in the terminal
```shell
> fc-list # all font of your system
> fc-list | grep "JetBrains" # get font from font list using regular expression
> fc-cache # clear font cache (when installed font is not working you can try this) 
> fc-cache -r # more powerful than fc-cache
```
